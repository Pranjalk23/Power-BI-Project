# Sales Insights Dashboard - Power BI Project

This project demonstrates the creation of a sales insights dashboard using Power BI, leveraging a sales dataset. The dashboard focuses on providing actionable insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends through data modeling, transformation, and DAX queries.

## Project Overview

The sales dataset, a classic example of a relational database, provides a rich source of information about sales transactions, customers, and products. This project aims to transform this raw data into a comprehensive sales insights dashboard that empowers stakeholders to:

* **Analyze sales trends:** Identify popular product categories, sales regions, and seasonal patterns.
* **Understand customer behavior:** Segment customers based on purchase frequency, spending, and demographics.
* **Evaluate sales performance:** Compare sales across different stores, staff members, and time periods.
* **Gain actionable insights:** Visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and identify areas for improvement.

## Key Technologies

* **Power BI Desktop:** For data modeling, transformation, and dashboard creation.
* **Sales Dataset:** The source of data for the project.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For creating custom calculations and measures.
* **Power Query (M Language):** For data cleaning and transformation.

## Data Modeling

The relational sales dataset was transformed into a star schema for optimal performance and analysis. Key tables include:

* **Sales:** Contains sales transaction data.
* **Customer:** Customer demographic and contact information.
* **Product:** Product details, including category and price.
* **Store:** Store location and staff information.
* **Date:** Date dimension for time-based analysis.

The data model was designed to ensure proper relationships between tables, enabling accurate aggregation and filtering. Details of the data model can be found in `Documentation/Data_Model.md`.

## Data Transformation

Power Query was used to clean and transform the raw sales data. Key transformations include:

* **Data type conversions:** Ensuring correct data types for each column.
* **Data cleaning:** Handling null values, inconsistencies, and duplicates.
* **Calculated columns:** Creating derived columns like profit, sales margin, and customer lifetime value.
* **Merging and appending queries:** Combining related tables for analysis.
* **Creating date tables:** generating a date table for time intelligence functions.

Detailed steps are outlined in `Documentation/Data_Transformation.md`.

## DAX Queries

DAX was used to create custom measures and calculated columns for advanced analysis. Examples of DAX queries include:

* **Total Sales:** `Total Sales = SUM(FactSales[SalesAmount])`
* **Total Profit:** `Total Profit = SUM(FactSales[ProfitAmount])`
* **Average Order Value:** `Average Order Value = AVERAGE(FactSales[SalesAmount])`
* **Top 10 Products by Revenue:** Calculating top performing products.
* **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):** Calculating customer's total spending.
* **Sales Trend by Month/Year:** Analyzing sales patterns over time.

A comprehensive list of DAX queries is provided in `Documentation/DAX_Queries.md`.

## Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes the following key features:

* **Interactive visualizations:** Charts, tables, and maps for exploring data.
* **Key performance indicators (KPIs):** Highlighting critical metrics like total sales, profit, and customer count.
* **Slicers and filters:** Enabling users to drill down into specific segments of data.
* **Trend analysis:** Visualizing sales trends over time.
* **Customer segmentation:** Identifying high-value customers.
* **Store performance comparison:** Analyzing sales across different stores.

## Getting Started

1.  **Download the Sales Dataset:** Obtain the sales dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or a public data source).
2.  **Open the Power BI Project:** Open the `Sales_Dashboard.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
3.  **Configure Data Source:** Update the data source connection settings in Power BI to point to your sales dataset.
4.  **Explore the Dashboard:** Interact with the visualizations and explore the insights.

## Future Enhancements

* **Predictive Analytics:** Incorporate forecasting and predictive modeling to anticipate future sales trends.
* **Advanced Customer Segmentation:** Implement more sophisticated customer segmentation techniques.
* **Real-time Data Integration:** Integrate with live data sources for up-to-date insights.
* **Mobile Optimization:** Optimize the dashboard for mobile devices.
* **Implement RLS (Row Level Security):** Add security so that only specific users can see certain data.
